# RETEVIS-RT3S-OPENGD77-UK-CODEPLUG
In this repo i will share my opengd77 codeplug for the Retevis RT3s which is using the opengd77 firmware (https://www.opengd77.com).

This was a Uk wide codeplug created initially by a fellow ham m0xrs that i decided to modify to use with my pi-star hotspot.

It holds uk wide analogue and digital repeaters. Ive added a few more local repeaters. Has im located in Wigan the North West Zone repeaters have been rearranged to the local repeaters sorted by distance from my QTH in Wigan.

I have also added zones to use with my pistar hotspot both using the Brandmeister and TGIF Networks.

In this codeplug i use a pistar zero simplex hotspot on the 434.00000Mhz frequency.
